# Data Provenance — reviewer-facing audit trail

Every on-screen number in this explorable must trace to a primary source **and** a
digitization record. This file is that record. It is the code-of-conduct against the
"invented curve" failure mode (see `task_list.md`, Golden rule).

For every data file under `data/` (added milestone by milestone), record:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **File** | the JSON asset, e.g. `data/self-consistency.json` |
| **Source** | paper + exact figure/table number |
| **Extraction method** | `WebPlotDigitizer on Fig. X` · `verbatim table value` · `derived` |
| **Raw points** | the extracted `(x, y)` values before any fitting |
| **Fit** | fitted-function form + parameters, if any |
| **Citation** | matches the `citation` field in the JSON |
| **Notes** | tolerance, preprint flag, source conflicts |

## Schema guarantee (enforced in code)

`src/lib/data.ts` rejects any data file missing a `citation` (`{ ref, url, venue, preprint }`)
or a `provenance` string. A unit test asserts this. No page ships a number without provenance.

## Known source conflicts to resolve against primary papers

- **Page 18 (faithfulness), misalignment-hint admission rates.** The two planning docs
  disagree: `InferenceTimeScaling_Explainable.md` says **20% / 29%** (Claude / R1);
  `InferenceTimeScaling_Survey.md` says **41% / 19%**. Resolve against the primary paper
  (Chen et al./Anthropic 2025, arXiv:2505.05410) before building, and record the resolved
  value here.
